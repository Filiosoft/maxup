## Name

Currently, we have named this project `s3d`. That is an incredibly boring name. It stands for S3 Deploy. Again, very boring. We would love to give it a new name that sounds good. If you have an idea, feel free to create an [issue](/issues)! These are the requirements for the name:

- Short. Less than 5 characters. The shorter the better.
- Available on [NPM](https://npmjs.com). 
- Available domain name. (That sounds good)
- Shouldn't conflict with any preinstalled binaries
